## 3. About the Project
This project aims to revolutionize urban traffic management by developing an intelligent system that adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions, pedestrian activity, and emergency vehicle priority. It utilizes advanced sensors and AI algorithms to predict traffic patterns and optimize flow.
## 4. Features
- Real-Time Traffic Analysis: Uses cameras and sensors to monitor traffic conditions.
- AI-Driven Predictive Timing: Adjusts signal timings based on predicted traffic flow.
- Emergency Vehicle Priority: Automatically clears intersections for emergency vehicles.
- Pedestrian Safety Features: Adaptive walk signals for safer crossings.
## 5. Usage
The system can be used by city planners to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. It provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and adjusting signal timings.
## 6. Roadmap
- Phase 1: Deploy a pilot system in a small urban area.
- Phase 2: Expand to larger city-wide implementation.
- Phase 3: Integrate with public transit systems.
